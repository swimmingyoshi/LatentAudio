Users who modify or redistribute LatentAudio code or official models must comply with the AGPL.

## Network and Distributed Use

Use of LatentAudio in networked services, hosted applications, or distributed binaries (including audio plugins) triggers the AGPL requirement to provide complete corresponding source code, including model weights and any modifications.
