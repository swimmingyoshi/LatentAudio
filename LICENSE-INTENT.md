# License Intent – LatentAudio

LatentAudio is open-source software created to empower musicians, sound designers, and developers to explore, generate, and experiment with audio using neural networks.

## Key Principles

1. **Code**  
   - All GUI, VST plugin, and training scripts are licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)**.
   - This ensures the software remains free and open, and any modifications or derivative works are also shared under the same license.

2. **Official Models**  
   - Pretrained models released by the LatentAudio team are licensed separately under **Creative Commons Attribution–NonCommercial (CC-BY-NC 4.0)**.
   - This allows anyone to experiment, remix, and share, but prohibits commercial use without explicit permission.

3. **User-Generated Models**  
   - Models trained using LatentAudio by end users are **owned by the users**.
   - The AGPL license does **not** give us control over models they create.
   - Users are encouraged to share improvements, but it is voluntary.

4. **Community & Contributions**  
   - We encourage forking, improving, and contributing back to reduce bugs, optimize performance, and expand the creative potential.
   - Proper attribution to the LatentAudio project is appreciated in forks, derivative works, and shared models.

5. **No Exploitative Monetization**  
   - LatentAudio was created to promote creativity, not personal profit.  
   - The AGPL and CC-BY-NC licenses enforce open-source principles and non-commercial use of official models, aligning with this vision.
